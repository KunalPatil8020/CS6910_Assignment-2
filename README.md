# CS6910_Assignment-2

The goal of this assignment is threefold: (i) train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualise filters (ii) finetune a pre-trained model just as you would do in many real world applications (iii) use an existing pre-trained model for a cool application.


## Prerequisites
Python 3.7.10\
Numpy 1.19.5\
Tensorflow 2.4.1
## Dataset
We have used the iNaturalist Dataset ("https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip").
## Installing
Install the required libraries in your environment using this command:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## For data preparation
For data prepocessing for both parts use data_preprocessing.py
## Part A
All codes have been created in Google Colab with a GPU backend and save here as .py files. You can diretly copy paste the code in collab with suitable changes.

Data preprocessing is common to both parts

To run a full code of part A, use Part_A.py. You will also get collab link in the file.
## Part B
All codes have been created in Google Colab with a GPU backend and save here as .py files. You can diretly copy paste the code in collab with suitable changes.

Data preprocessing is common to both parts

To run a full code of part B, use Part_B.py. You will also get collab link in the file.
